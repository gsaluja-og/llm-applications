Using GPT4 vision API to play Blackjack online.
1. The bot takes a screenshot of the game area on the screen. (Remember to redefine these variables in the code based on your game screen dimensions!)
2. It sends this picture to GPT vision API, which analyzes the image and returns the best next move.
3. Using some Python code (PyAutoGUI), the bot executes that action on the screen.
See video for demo use.
